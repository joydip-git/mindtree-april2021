JS - dynamic compilation

JS does not provide any static compiler like C, C++, etc.
there is no compile time checking
during the time of execution JS code will be compiled and then executed

NOT a strictly typed language, rather it is as loose typed language
int x = "joydip";

var x = "joydip"
x = 10
x.toLocaleLowerCase()
