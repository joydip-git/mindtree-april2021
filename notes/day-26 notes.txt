an application - RESTful API: [JSON-SERVER]
	host data
	other appp can make request for the data, manipulate the data (add, update, delete) etc.
	requests will be via HTTP
	share the data in JSON or XML format or any other format
	generally will be hosted/deployed in some machine (server)

the app hosting data and the app requesting data are loosely coupled: the client (anagular/react/vue etc.) and the data server app(the app hosting the data) they just interact via HTTP request and uses an agreed format of data (JSON/XML)

client app (angular/react etc.):
a. direct raw Ajax or need some api to make asynmchronous request (HTTP) and the URL of the host of the data
	fetch (browser API), axios (third party package)
b. response expected might take some time to be retrieved
c. the request must be asynchronous and you must have facility of updating the UI after response has been received

state of data: attriburtes + values (of the attributes) about an object
